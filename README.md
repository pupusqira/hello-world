# hello-world

Hi everyone,
My name is Pupus Qira, from Master student from Institut Technology of Bandung, Indonesia.

I'am new at seismology and machine learning

There is a reason why I interested with that is my enviromental background. Indonesia lies on 2 tectonic plate. Eurasia and Australia plate. According to Metrology and Geophysics Indonesia agency, form 1967-2006 there are 3.486 earthquake with up tp 6 SR magnitude, 27 devastating earthquake, and 13 induced Tsunami. Because of that, i want to start learn about seismology to make hazard mitigation analysis and build some code with so all of you can discuss..

it will be great if you contact me and make some project about earthquake and machine learning together

Best Regrad
